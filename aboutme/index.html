            I'm Wei.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a web developer currently looking for opportunities after honing my skills at General Assembly. I love solving puzzles, puns, and silly things. I love being challenged so I'm often taking on challenges- you'll often find me trying new things out, to see if it works, just to learn how things work.

          <p>
            After high school in Singapore, I moved permanently back to London and studied medicine at King College London and worked at a charity for a while. While I love working with and helping people, Iâ€™ve always wanted to design and make things, so I decided to gain the skills to make things I love and joined a web development boot-camp. I enjoyed it immensely, building things  and being able to express  different creative ideas, and am continuing my journey learning and improving the way I make things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always had a very wide set of interests- I used to play field hockey, swim and play ultimate frisbee, debate in inter-secondary-school debates, present my projects at national science fairs, be active in the creative writing scene in Singapore (writing poetry), I have a black belt in karate, and I even sung (badly) in a comedy band. I've always been interested in technology, and always been geeky- reading comics, Isaac Asimov sci-fi/fantasy novels and playing around on computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm often super curious, and always willing to try new things. I try to be in a position where I'm a little out of my comfort zone, because I think that's the only way to grow, and I love solving puzzles and problems where I struggle to find the right answers.

The project was done as part of Electron's 23:00:01 Hackathon, a 23hour and one second hackathon. This project was super fun to do, especially with the team of Peter Le and Ryan Thomas Didier McWard.

            Before seriously embarking on learning how to code, I worked at a charity linking the elderly with schools to help provide support to schools while alleviating social isolation in the elderly. There, I generated statistics and analysis for marketing and management purposes as well as identifying resources and appropriate schools for expansion and development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of a small 4 man adminstration team, I performed a variety of general administrative tasks such as advertising work opportunities, documenting business practices, filing, and technical support. Intergen has since been subsumed under its parent charity- From Generation to Generation.

            As part of living in Singapore for more than 5 years while under 18, I got drafted into the Singapore Army. There, I went through Officer Training School to learn how to command a platoon of troops and did things like climb hills and survive in a Thai jungle.

            After that I got posted to a manpower officer position at Basic Military Training Centre, where I did things like helping to organise events like graduation and intake parades, assigning training staff allocation, and doing other administrative things like being secretary to commander meetings

            I served the Singapore army as a statutory requirement of living in Singapore. Read more about National Service here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore">Wikipedia link</a>

            I did a stint as a research assistant at Singapore General Hospital before joining the Army. There, I collected and compiled data for the radiology department, which was used in audits to review the effectiveness of various treatments and medical assessments

          <h3>Life Before Work</h3>
          <p class="small">
            1987 - 2005

            Before all that more important stuff, I did a whole lot of growing up kind of stuff. I started doing the growing thing after being born in Croydon, London. I think the first memories I actually have are of looking at ducks at a castle (Dover?).

            I went to school for a little bit in England, but then I moved to Singapore, where I started school proper, and ended up being identified for Singapore's Gifted Education Programme. There, I met a whole bunch of really interesting people, and when I was in Secondary School, I started to play field hockey, swim, debate, write poety and participate in creative writing events, do science fairs, and learn karate. I also started taking photos for fun, trying to learn how to draw, learned some basic HTML and CSS, and sat around on ICQ and various MUDs.
          </p>
            Before working, I went to high school in Anglo-Chinese Junior College, where I played hockey and was part of the creative writing club. And (like virtually everyone else in my generation in South East Asia) started playing DOTA and reached my maximum height.
