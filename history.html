              Most recently I did a 12 week coding bootcamp, that has allowed me to make this website, and picked up a lot of the tech skills that I've listed on the other page. But of course, all this tech is just the start of the journey- there's always more to learn and do!

              Before seriously embarking on learning how to code, I worked at a charity linking the elderly with schools to help provide support to schools while alleviating social isolation in the elderly. There, I generated statistics and analysis for marketing and management purposes as well as identifying resources and appropriate schools for expansion and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of a small 4 man adminstration team, I performed a variety of general administrative tasks such as advertising work opportunities, documenting business practices, filing, and technical support. Intergen has since been subsumed under its parent charity- From Generation to Generation.

              I did most of an MBBS Medicine programme before leaving in the final year. I competed all core and specialty medical rotations of the programme.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the course, aside from the academic side, I did a lot of work within hospitals as a medical student, interviewing and interpreting patient information to present during hospital ward rounds and emergency shifts. I also participated in surgeries, did medical presentations, prepared medical papers and explained medical information to patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also played ultimate (the competitive form of Frisbee) while at KCL.

              As part of living in Singapore for more than 5 years while under 18, I got drafted into the Singapore Army. There, I went through Officer Training School to learn how to command a platoon of troops and did things like climb hills and survive in a Thai jungle.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that I got posted to a manpower officer position at Basic Military Training Centre, where I did things like helping to organise events like graduation and intake parades, assigning training staff allocation, and doing other administrative things like being secretary to commander meetings
            </p>
            <p>
              I served the Singapore army as a statutory requirement of living in Singapore. Read more about National Service here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore">Wikipedia link</a>

              I did a stint as a research assistant at Singapore General Hospital before joining the Army. There, I collected and compiled data for the radiology department, which was used in audits to review the effectiveness of various treatments and medical assessments

            <p class="small">
              1987 - 2005
            </p>
            <p>
              Before all that more important stuff, I did a whole lot of growing up kind of stuff. I started doing the growing thing after being born in Croydon, London. I think the first memories I actually have are of looking at ducks at a castle (Dover?).
            </p>
            <p>
              I went to school for a little bit in England, but then I moved to Singapore, where I started school proper, and ended up being identified for Singapore's Gifted Education Programme. There, I met a whole bunch of really interesting people, and when I was in Secondary School, I started to play field hockey, swim, debate, write poety and participate in creative writing events, do science fairs, and learn karate. I also started taking photos for fun, trying to learn how to draw, learned some basic HTML and CSS, and sat around on ICQ and various MUDs.
            </p>
              Before working, I went to high school in Anglo-Chinese Junior College, where I played hockey and was part of the creative writing club. And (like virtually everyone else in my generation in South East Asia) started playing DOTA and reached my maximum height.
