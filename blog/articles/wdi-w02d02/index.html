          <section class="content"><p>Day starting with a really short homework review. It’s good that everyone’s getting comfortable, and it looks like no one had significant problems today with the work. Good stuff.<span class="more"></span> Chanse looks like the go-to guy for stylin’ so I gotta pick up some tips from him. Cool&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Went through ‘this’ even more. I get it now, but it’s kinda weird to really work with it. Useful though. But still&nbsp;weird</p>
<p>Also went through object oriented programming, and I actually find it easier now to go through it using object oriented programming. I can problem make it a lot more efficient at storing the values, but for now at least I can contruct really&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>Homework was realistically really short, but I stayed back a long time to work through stuff with other people who were having issues. And think about other approaches to any of the problems or stuff that I did. Quite good to help people debug because it really helps me understand how to find my own errors, and it’s quite challenging some times. Left much later than I should have probably though, having too much fun. Also left my charger there, like a boob. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
