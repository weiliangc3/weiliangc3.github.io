          <section class="content"><p><span class="caps">WDI</span> started, and I was told it would be useful to record the things I did, maybe the thoughts I had, and oh the place I’ll go. So I guess I’ll start with where I’ve&nbsp;begun.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I’ve started a Web Development Intensive course at General Assembly, where I should be learning how to use javascript, java libraries, and ruby and its associated libraries. My previous experience is mostly copy pasting with mild modifications scripts for Excel or <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS back from 2004. While I’d done some Codeacademy javascript before the course, and the precourse javascript work, I’d never really done any of the hard stuff, or had anything to really build with the coding languages that I was&nbsp;taught.</p>
<p>So today I installed a bunch of stuff on a MacBook which I’ve borrowed from a good friend for the course, learned how to fold a great paper aeroplane, and had a pint at a&nbsp;pub.</p>
<p>Fairly productive first day, except for the installing- that was incredibly&nbsp;dry.</p>
