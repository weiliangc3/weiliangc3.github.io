I feel&nbsp;bad…</p>
<p>but I might not do any of it? I might do some of it? We’ll&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>It’s project time, and we’re really into it now. Nothing to really report. Just more wire framing for me today, set my tasks up tomorrow morning, and gogogo. Having a bit more fun that I should be wire framing, and really thinking about the layout and what’s really needed. As a result, I have a lot of things that I’ve cut, and realised isn’t core, but is really useful. Pretty good to really dedicate a day to simply just planning. Usually I structure and go, then plan steps and approaches as I go along, see how this structure goes for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll try this pomodoro technique thing? I dunno we’ll&nbsp;see.</p>
