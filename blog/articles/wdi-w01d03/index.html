          <section class="content"><p>I realise I have a somewhat irreverent description of my time in <span class="caps">WDI</span> in GA. To clarify, I still think about the course a lot, it’s just that my learning is fairly directed and easy to describe, so it comes out as succinct comments.<span class="more"></span> The other small bits about the day just amuse me, but are a lot harder for me to describe. I record the day’s progress by a series of notes, and a vast majority of them aren’t strictly work&nbsp;related.</p>
<p>So my goal in sitting today, after sitting next to the air conditioner that blew cold air at me most of the day on Tuesday, was to sit on the left near the window. Become Dayman, fighter of the Nightman, champion of the sun. I must say, I really like the sides for the extra space to put your bag and water and stuff. And the sunny side is more pleasant, but doesn’t have as good a view on the board, since the board is on the right and our instructor, Alex, is right&nbsp;handed.</p>
<p>I also decided to travel much further for food for lunch, all the way to the Japanese Kitchen, which Cat suggested. I had the Korean Fried Chicken donburi for 6 pds, and it was pretty big, and really tasty. I realise I’m spending a lot on food for a person on course. I’ll cut down as time rolls on, but food is a fairly personal thing, and culturally and personally, I value eating. I don’t spend much on other things, but I definitely love eating- and in general I eat a&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p>Standard scrum, didn’t drop the duck, and I presented my website. Fairly happy with it, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it really was, but I’d really like to fix a lot of it to be neater in my head. It’s probably never-ending, refining your website until you’re completely happy with it, but the website is certainly functional. It’s pointed out I should get in the habit of using tags like &amp;lta&gt; and &amp;ltnav&gt; and things like that to at least denote what things are meant to be and so&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>After which we went through positioning, floating, and clearing in <span class="caps">CSS</span>, a topic which I really feel is just a matter of practice, since the more sites you build, the more familiar you’re going to end up with how the positioning all works. As it is, it really feels like the differences between inline and inline float, seem rather unclear, but I guess in time they will seem more&nbsp;obvious.</p>
<p>Had an outcomes talk, about finding a job, the game-plan kinda job. I always get a little nervous about these things, because pitching at the right level always feels a little challenging. Am I being overconfident and cocky? Am I underselling the things I can do? Especially when my depth of technical knowledge and industry knowledge isn’t really there, I always get nervous about these outcome&nbsp;talks.</p>
<p>Then came an intro to javascript, and command flows, and in the afternoon we did paired programming of a basic game using basic javascript command flows, ‘if’s, ‘else’s, ‘while’s, ‘for’s and ‘switch’es. Also returning results using alerts and console.logs. I’d done quite a bit of it before so it all felt fairly natural, as did the homework of making a javascript prompt driven calculator. Working with Faduma was fairly easy, but for sure I found it difficult explaining exactly the kind of game that I wanted to create in concrete terms that would help code. The problem I suspect is that I’m building the structure of the code as I describe what I want, which ends up being too specific for a guideline, and not specific enough to actually be code. While this makes the coding decisions easier for me, it did mean that when Faduma was coding, how or what to code isn’t fully clear. I somewhat felt like I was mostly leading her, so I feel a little bad about it, but I honestly hope she got something out of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I must admit, both my projects today were very entertaining for me to build, and probably very self indulgent. The game Faduma and I built was a simulation of Monty Python’s Bridge of Doom skit in The Quest for The Holy Grail, which asks 3 questions and kills knights if you answer it badly. She suggested a quiz, and off the cuff that was the first game-like quiz that came to my mind. Following on the theme, I named the calculator we made for homework ‘The Mathemagician’. I also added a lot of attitude to the prompts, and the calculator constantly insults you while doing the operations. A very user-unfriendly calculator. I enjoyed it, but I would not recommend actually using it for anything but your own amusement a few times. Probably a low Metacritic Score. Would not see on Steam&nbsp;Greenlight.</p>
<p>This is a really long blog post, mostly because I finished the work really quickly and painlessly today, so there’s not much mental fatigue. The posts’ll probably thin out over&nbsp;time.</p>
