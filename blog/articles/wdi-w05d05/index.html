          <section class="content"><p>Skipped the morning lunch and went for a short run instead. I think I like doing this more than going for breakfast unless I actually have questions to casually ask at breakfast, <span class="more"></span>but that’s a very utilitarian way of viewing&nbsp;breakfast.</p>
<p>In terms of learning, we basically did testing today. <span class="caps">TDD</span> for ruby and then TDD for Sinatra. All spec, and some shoulda for the Sinatra stuff. Again, Fridays are slowish in terms of material to make sure everything’s covered and we’re all good to go for the&nbsp;weekend.</p>
<p>Decided to focus on how negative flat design works, so I just decided to use a set of tables/relationships that I was really comfortable with. So I used a gaming set of relationships, and spent most of my time thinking about how to fit components in etc. Quite&nbsp;fun.</p>
