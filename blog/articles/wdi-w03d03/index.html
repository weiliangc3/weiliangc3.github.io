          <section class="content"><p>Today we’re back to learning, and what a doozy it was. We started easy, with mostly a history lesson and an outline of how the Internet works. <span class="more"></span>Then we had an outcomes talk, about pitching yourself. I feel like that’s probably one of my weak points, I’m not entirely sure why but I’m never really comfortable talking about myself positively, especially to strangers. It’s a skill I really&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>Then it got real hard real fast. Intro to Node, which was reasonable, then quickly accelerating to coding what I understand to be a server for a website using express, using npm, and then left us to figure out how to get form data, how to print it on a website, etc etc for homework. I totally had difficulty figuring out how to build the server from scratch, because the pace was so fast, but I guess if I do it more it might become second nature. For now I can just follow the steps, I understand the functions but I won’t be able to piece them together myself and remember what’s missing etc for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Homework turned out to be easy right after you figured out how to build the server, the rest I was pretty comfortable with figuring out, since you can tell where everything points. Then I spammed memes, helped explain stuff to others since the TAs weren’t around, and went home. Still sick, so better get more&nbsp;sleep.</p>
