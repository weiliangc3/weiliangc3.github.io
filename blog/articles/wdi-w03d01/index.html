<span class="more"></span>
Got in late today due to Easter transport being messed up. Left half an hour early, and arrived half an hour late. One of the buses straight up ignored me and just rolled on through. I mean it’s Easter right but if you’re going to go to work at least do your job and let others get their stuff done. He sprayed me with water too to add insult to&nbsp;injury.</p>
<p>Anyway, after trying to doge-ify my game by adding doge pictures and nonsense like that into my game to make it cuter and more amusing, I drove Peter’s project into a very meme heavy direction. One that I think is hilarious, and I think Alex approves. In his case at least. In my case he just told me to clean up my <span class="caps">UI</span> elements and decide on a design direction. Which is fair enough, I like these New Courier fonts, but I think most people actually hate them. Instead went for the Sans Serif route and Verdana-ed the whole thing to make it look cleaner. Pity I can’t use cooler fonts. Amusingly, I think Peter’s game is going to benefit heavily from the Doge-ification of it, with the game having a lot more punch, a lot more character, and a lot more levity. My game just has a lot of functionality, and not as much design, which is kinda fair- secretly Peter’s been getting help from his design grad brother, which is totally cool. I just wanted a fun bullet hell game, which I&nbsp;got.</p>
