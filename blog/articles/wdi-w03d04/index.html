          <section class="content"><p><span class="caps">WDI</span> started, and I was told it would be useful to record the things I did, maybe the thoughts I had, and oh the place I’ll go. So I guess I’ll start with where I’ve&nbsp;begun.</p>
<p>Ran through doing servers again today. Really felt like this was the slog that I’m just not used to at all. <span class="more"></span>The amount of steps is staggering, and I’m really not sure I’m going to remember all of them. For now I just take the steps as is and just follow, but one day I hope to be comfortable enough to get it done without having to use&nbsp;references.</p>
<p>Went through <span class="caps">CRUD</span> and the 7 RESTful actions, basically just templates to use when manipulating form data. I quite enjoy these kinds of things, organisation is incredibly important to really getting things working, but I also kinda feel this doesn’t need to be a full&nbsp;lesson.</p>
<p>The homework was pretty much the same stuff as the day, so it should have been pretty easy… but it wasn’t. I tried to write the server from scratch again, to get familiar and to learn more, and then I tried to use a npm module I hadn’t learned yet. So I built my site, got it working, and then tried to edit… then my site didn’t work. I struggled for like an hour an hour half, only to discover… it was my server that was what was&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>After that I made a page full of pugs to make myself feel good.&nbsp;#feelsgoodman</p>
