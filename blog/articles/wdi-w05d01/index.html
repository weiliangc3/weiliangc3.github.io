          <section class="content"><p>Today we basically did <span class="caps">SQL</span>. So we started with an intro to SQL and postgres (PSQL), and drawing data charts and stuff, and then we did SQL queries. <span class="more"></span>I struggled heavily with <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries, because I couldn’t understand how JOIN was working or how to look into multiple tables. But the lesson moved swiftly&nbsp;on…</p>
<p>Next we linked <span class="caps">SQL</span> to ruby via ‘pg’ and then made a restful website with SQL. Overall I admit my full understanding of how this all works and how to type it blind etc etc is still pretty hazy, so I hope over time I’ll get more practice and be able to type all of this stuff without having to fully rely on copying and pasting code that had previously worked and that we had done before. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>For homework we had to do Carmen Sandiago via <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries. Which I was fairly happy to get as homework, because I knew I needed practice with it, but I strapped myself in to struggle with it. And struggle I did. Then near the end, came a watershed moment where I saw JOIN’s face clearly, and understood what it did. I still didn’t understand her language, but I saw what JOIN could do, and some of how I could use it. It was quite a gratifying moment… but then the last question didn’t need a JOIN and that was&nbsp;it.</p>
