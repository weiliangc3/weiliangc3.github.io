          <section class="content"><p>Not a particularly challenging day in terms of most of the lessons. Officially we went through the tic-tac-toe solution that uses arrays to store moves.<span class="more"></span> I originally considered using arrays to store moves, and then using indexOf() !== -1 to check for winners, but I decided using the innerHTML to store data was more elegant a solution. After looking at the code, I’m not sure which is better, but they both work. I must admit I’m probably more interested in the pseudo <span class="caps">AI</span> and some of the bugs it still&nbsp;has.</p>
<p>Mostly we went through tic tac toe to reinforce understanding of functions and scope, but I felt really comfortable with it anyway so it was quite relaxing for me. Then we were taught objects, which also was fairly&nbsp;comfortable</p>
<p>Then he introduced a little bit of object oriented programming, and explained ‘this’, both really briefly because we were running out of time in the day. With not much detail, I’m fairly sure most of that just whizzed over people’s heads. I mostly got it, but I still really need to play around with it to fully understand what it all means and the advantages&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Capped off the day by explaining prototypes and audio briefly, and then&nbsp;homework.</p>
<p>Homework was really short for me, and I know Peter had no issues either, make a soundboard. I finished the functions and the framework, leaving only extra stuff and <span class="caps">CSS</span>, within an hour half, and went off to dinner. Didn’t spend as much time as I wanted to on the homework- didn’t make it object oriented, but I did pretty much understand ‘this’ and binding&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow explains the issues I had with ‘this’ and expands on object oriented programming. Alex explained ‘this’ to me and some other functions, which is what led me to look up binding, which helped me understand ‘this’ in turn. He also suggested that in my free time I make my tic tac toe object oriented, so that I fully understand object oriented programming. But take it step by&nbsp;step.</p>
