          <section class="content"><p>Had a bad day today. Real bad.
<span class="more"></span>
Class itself wasn’t too bad, logins, sessions and authentications. Fairly easy conceptually, just building more on top of the knowledge we already have. Did it in the lab, and it was really clear to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Then we had a review of how relationships work, how we can play with it. We kinda ran through how we would assign values really quickly, and I’m not super clear about it yet, but other than that content wise today wasn’t too&nbsp;tough.</p>
<p>The bad day started the moment I started on homework. I decided I’d do Bourbon, and I was angry and stubborn and decided that I would learn something rather than just do something I was feeling comfortable with. Then Bourbon with bitter and Bower didn’t play nice and started putting up a fight. So I fought with Bower, fought with Bourbon, and fought for 2 hours. In the end I got so angry that I decided if Bitters needed a Bourbon it liked, and Bower wouldn’t serve me the Bourbon that Bitters wanted, then I’m not having Bourbon or Bitter. I’ll just throw everything to the ground, tie up my stuff with Bootstrap, and get on the road. So I did. But now I’ve got a bitter taste in my&nbsp;mouth.</p>
<p>So I posted a question to the group chat and hopefully we’ll have a look at a good way of installing&nbsp;Bourbon.</p>
