          <section class="content"><p>Today we went through <span class="caps">SCSS</span>/Sass, asset packs, and bower. Feels a bit like a haze, I honestly can barely remember what we learned today. <span class="more"></span><span class="caps">SCSS</span> I understand, it’s a CSS simplifier that compiles scss into css. I think I understand bower, it’s like a package manager for front end stuff. Not sure I understand assetpack, I think it’s a compiler for everything, but I’m not sure where bower ends and asset pack begins or even where SCSS fits into it. A bit of a weird day, like it all kind of melds into one, and I can see how to use it but not how the pieces of the puzzle are shaped and how they fit&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Homework is ramping up for me. I’ve hit the point where I’m forgoing functionality or style to finish everything I want to finish (though tbh I’m aiming above the minimum spec of the homework). I’m still managing to finish what my priorities are, but I’m no longer having the time to really make stuff fantastic. A lot of it I feel is muscle work rather than brain work, so by the time you hit the brain work, you’ve spent a lot of time tackling other muscle-work fine-touch kind of things, so you’re tired. I guess the goal is to make your stuff bug free and almost in muscle&nbsp;memory.</p>
