          <section class="content"><p>Today we had outcomes, did a huge homework review of how to make blackjack, and learned how classes in ruby work and how inheritance works.
<span class="more"></span>
Outcomes was interesting, got an old hand who came in and talked about his journey. I guess it’s probably a good idea for me to go out and network. I always feel a little eh about networking, I’m not naturally a very outgoing person, but I’ve sort of pushed myself towards that direction. Other than that I guess there’s not that much new&nbsp;news.</p>
<p>Classes in ruby… I understand them but I’m not sure if “object oriented programming” is something that you do in ruby. Feels a little weird? Like there aren’t really objects to orient to? I mean there are definitely objects to orient myself to but I don’t know if you straight up just program within an object like you do in&nbsp;Javascript</p>
<p>Homework was making a command-line ruby program simulating an animal shelter, with various functions like registering animals, registering people, etc etc. Conceptually not difficult, but I made it really hard by the amount of input checking I did and the fact that I fundamentally misunderstood the role of the animal shelter. Only 4 functions were requested but I ended up with 6. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>2 interesting bugs- one with require_relative and another with trying to use attr_accessor to redefine local variables within an instance of a class. I’ll try to ask tomorrow, I can’t really find an answer&nbsp;online.</p>
