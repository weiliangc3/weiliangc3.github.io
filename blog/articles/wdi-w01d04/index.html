          <section class="content"><p>Today we did functions, and <span class="caps">DOM</span>, and thus making our javascript interact with webpages. Quite challenging, I developed a headache that still hasn’t gone away and it’s 2am.<span class="more"></span> I suspect I’m overthinking a lot of things, and tracking a lot of things I don’t need to track in my head and that’s what’s giving me the headache. It feels like the same kind of headache when I start planning too far ahead than what is comfortable for me in games like Go or even Spacechem (a puzzle game) some times. Either that or it’s just staring at the screen too much and the light is giving me&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of keeping my code dry, and using a lot of functions to simplify a lot of the code that you use. I really like tidy looking code that I can easily interpret, otherwise it just annoys me. Simple is beautiful, what can I&nbsp;say.</p>
