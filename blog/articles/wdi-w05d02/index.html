          <section class="content"><p>Lots and lots of learning and syntax to really understand and process today. Challenging in a different way because the struggle wasn’t a matter of ‘technique’ but more a matter of ’strength’. Lots of material, but conceptually not difficult- so one of my weaker types of days. <span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Did introduction to Rack and Modular set up of an app for deployment. Learned about tux, migrations and linking <span class="caps">SQL</span> tables. And finally made a RESTful site integrating Sql using Active Record. Lots of things that have basically already been done but in a sort of messy&nbsp;illogical.</p>
<p>Finally for homework, RESTful website with a sql database. I took an hour off and got a haircut, so I didn’t get as much styling done as I wanted to, but tried my hand for the first time at a negatively designed website. I might continue making them, I’m not sure how they work design wise yet. Well, ‘hey ho’ and all&nbsp;that.</p>
