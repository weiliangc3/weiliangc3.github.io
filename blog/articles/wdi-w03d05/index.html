Lots of recap, talking about mafintosh, etc. The Internet went down midway through a lesson when we were supposed to be installing express-els-layouts, so we got completely stalled. So we made the American flag in <span class="caps">HTML</span> and CSS, and Alex brought his pom in. I love&nbsp;poms.</p>
<p>Then we played around with controllers and stuff, which I need to practice. Can’t really figure out what website to make right now, I think I’ll just make my Slack. I don’t really need something particularly outstanding, and I was actually really happy with my Pug homework design yesterday, so I think I’ll just focus on getting everything working, and see how it&nbsp;goes.</p>
