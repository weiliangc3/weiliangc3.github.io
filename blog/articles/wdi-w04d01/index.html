<span class="more"></span>
Ruby feels a little bit foreign to me, I guess I’m a little less ‘human’ now? I find the brackets and the clear notation of javascript a little comforting, but ruby’s just another language and I definitely agree the error handling for ruby feels so much more elegant and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>The other thing we learnt was Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice, or <span class="caps">MINASWAN</span>, which amuses me. Since Matz is JP, I’m sure it was made with the idea that we are all special swans, since ‘mina’ is ‘everyone’ in jp. Also I learnt he’s Mormon. So this all makes sense to me. JP is an unreasonably polite culture, and the Church of the Latter Day Saints are&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Then we learned about arrays and objects and symbols in Ruby, made a calculator, then&nbsp;homework.</p>
<p>Homework was really interesting to me, since the most elegant and novel solution isn’t the best solution. The elegant and novel solution involves assigning values based on a theoretical zero point. The normal solution just uses normal distance indexes. While both work, the elegant and novel solution is really short,but requires a little work to assign values. The other requires a lot more code, but ends up being scalable and adjustable. Kinda interesting. I guess it takes more code to be stable, but less code to be&nbsp;pretty.</p>
<p>In the end I wrote 180 lines. And most of it was because of stability and user experience. I can’t really tell how elegant my solution is, because of it… but it does work really&nbsp;smoothly.</p>
