          <section class="content"><p>Friday rolled round, a really chill day today actually. Went through a 3<span class="ord">rd</span> version of a calculator, <span class="more"></span>this time with numbered buttons that are the interface for input, as opposed to one with multiple input fields and operations. Kinda cool, I neglected the idea of simply changing the data in the <span class="caps">DOM</span> HTML as a form of storage until&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>On reflection, covered a lot of things this week. I wouldn’t be able to do what I can do now a week ago. It’s a lot of content, and they highlighted the amount of content we went through. I’m still not super challenged yet, but it’s been kinda fun challenging myself and reaching further than I probably&nbsp;should.</p>
<p>On Friday, we wrapped up early, and went to the pub after reviewing the week, and I pretty much was recommended not to start on my homework until Saturday, so get a good sleep and just start fresh. I admit I pretty much disregarded that advice, and got my homework to a submittable state on Friday night after about an hour and a&nbsp;half.</p>
<p>That being said, I did probably spend about 4-5 more hours on it, trying to add a lot more functionality, and playing around with the most elegant solutions to the code. In the end, I added a game win counter, added a function that basically stores each game played at the bottom of the screen, and finally programmed the computer to play against you. Since it’s tic-tac-toe, I basically programmed it to win or draw, since there is an optimal hand in tic-tac-toe. I also learned some tricks to style it. Actually the process of figuring how to program the computer to play tic-tac-toe, and how to style it, was really interesting and useful, and I thus probably spent way too much time on it that I should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>I also learned that sleeping on a problem really helps you get a solution. I was having a problem figuring out how to get the script to identify moves that would allow it to win, and I slept on the problem. And when I woke, I had the&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>Oh well, let’s see how the next week&nbsp;goes.</p>
