So everything’s finished with the project. Everyone had a bunch of really interesting problems and challenges. It’s really fun to think about other people’s problems and try to figure out exactly how they coded it. I think a lot of people’s solutions that they landed on in the end were probably more efficient and elegant than what I would have&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>Not much to talk about really. presentations and projects done, so now it’s learning tomorrow.&nbsp;Exciting.</p>
