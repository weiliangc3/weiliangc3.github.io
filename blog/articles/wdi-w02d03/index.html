          <section class="content"><p>Today was the introduction to JQuery, or as I am loathe to admit, Jake Weary. <span class="more"></span>A lot of things I wanted to do before but had to do it in a roundabout way or things that are just kinda repetitive. Which is totally cool, since I can see that typing things might just take&nbsp;forever.</p>
<p>Other than that, when homework rolled around I’d strapped myself in for a long hard night. We were shown a bunch of tweets, and told to populate a page with them. I immediately thought that I’d have to create individual elements, and after that plug in the values, but after a little reflection, I realised you can just append the whole thing into the right place, and just input values directly during the append. And in record time, I was done with the majority of the homework, so much that I had a lot of time to familiarise myself with&nbsp;JQuery.</p>
<p>In the end I stayed back really long because Tracy who was next to me decided on a totally different approach. Instead, she was appending the template texts, and then searching within the appended text and replacing it. A kinda inelegant solution, but an interesting one, because it inevitably really used a lot of Jquery. Ended up leaving late, but learning&nbsp;more.</p>
