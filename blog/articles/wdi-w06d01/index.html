          <section class="content"><p>Internet died for the morning so we got stuck doing nothing for quite a while. Looked at some websites and did a small quiz. <span class="more"></span>Then we installed rails and basically trivialised all the homework that had come&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>Then we learned to scaffold, and do all sorts of rails magic. All the printing of the partials etc&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what to say, today was a blitz of learning Rails, and really we learned a lot of what happens when we do stuff, but it’s a lot of stuff that we were writing to begin with. Like learning a lot of shortcuts, and a lot of new rules we have to follow to use&nbsp;Rails.</p>
<p>Then I did homework, didn’t plan, had no focus, had no purpose, and flubbed it. Very inefficient, and really&nbsp;poor.</p>
