          <section class="content"><p>It’s basically the start of our projects, and I discovered late last night that one of the alumni made Duck Hunt.<span class="more"></span> Not to be outdone, I decided to create dual element game in the vein of The World Ends With You, a dual screen game. Totally stoked to do it… until I actually had to do it. Without using libraries and stuff, I’m finding myself looking up online for a whole bunch of solutions to a whole bunch of&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>First an outline of the game:
2&nbsp;screens.</p>
<p>The main screen is a ‘bullet hell’ type game, where you use the arrow keys to move a box around the screen to avoid bullets that fly at&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>The second screen is a clicking type game, where you click the right coloured things or whatever sort of clicking mouse mini game I can think of, maybe a hover game. Success in this game gives positive feedback to the other game, maybe via removing enemies, or dropping extra health for the player to&nbsp;collect.</p>
<p>As a concept, and with other libraries and tools, it doesn’t seem terribly hard, since a lot of people make these kinds of games, but in raw javascript this has become some form of herculean task, where I’m thinking about the math of all the events and what I need to do, and at the same time trying to think of how javascript needs to work to do it. I’ll outline what problems I’ve met, and what I’ve&nbsp;solved.</p>
<p>Firstly I had to figure out how to make my player move. I’ve done that.
Then I had to figure out how to make collision detect. I’ve done&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The next problem is how to make collision stop things. For example I need to stop my player from flying out of the play&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>I’m getting a&nbsp;headache.</p>
