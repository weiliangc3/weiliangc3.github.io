          <section class="content"><p>Went through homework, and went through my bug. Not entirely sure how it works, but now I know where to look to see exactly what happened.<span class="more"></span> I actually sorta wanna know how the back end of Ruby works, because it doesn’t quite make sense to me. Though tbh functionally it isn’t a problem- I can just work around&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>So today we did Sinatra. Feels like we did all of what we did in express in Sinatra in a day. Pretty heavy. Getting data from forms, make controllers etc etc etc. I got really distracted halfway through since it really feels just like doing the same thing&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>For homework, we were supposed to make a randomiser. I’d done that before in a lot of my previous homeworks, and specifically a compliment generator I’d made in like week one. So instead, Alex was like… make a pokedex. So I made all the functionality of a pokedex, but really looking back on it I should have made the design of one instead. Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Not much to say. Homework wasn’t groundbreaking, but I spent such a long time building the infrastructure, and in the end didn’t do enough <span class="caps">CSS</span>, I feel. I probably should spend a lot more time on CSS. I did, however, learn how to make circles and stuff… so there is that. I still need to learn how to do responsive&nbsp;design.</p>
