          <section class="content"><p>So today we did Ruby enumerables, which I understood basically as a bunch of methods that Ruby has to manipulate its objects easily. <span class="more"></span>Then we did a benchmarking competition, and I lost terribly… but I did have code that could fit into twitter, and otherwise just looked gorgeously simple and easy to change. So there is&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Alex brought the dog again, I realised it’s not his dog and I was disappointed that we weren’t going to see that much more of it later. I learnt its name is Cerby, probably short for Cerberus, and I appreciated how fluffy it&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>Seems like a short day, but I was sadly quite distracted. I got a message from the Singapore Army that told me I needed to renew an exit permit that stops them from calling me in for army service. Then I realised I needed to login using some SingPass thing and it was really fiddly and I didn’t know my password etc etc… but I got it sorted in the end… and then I lost like about 2-3 hours of class in the haze. Pretty bad, but I think I caught&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Homework was blackjack, and it was a bit of a doozy. Following on from things that I don’t fully get and things I’m not fully comfortable with, I couldn’t really get everything I wanted in the game into the game. I got double working, and betting, and blackjack and push, but I didn’t put any jokes nor did I code split. Which is mildly disappointing for me. Oh well, in a way I’m fairly happy I’m still comfortable -enough- to push&nbsp;myself</p>
