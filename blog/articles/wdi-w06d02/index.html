          <section class="content"><p>In the morning I had an idea of how to fix all the bitters and bourbon etc problems I had. Then I had a look at the original fixes etc, and I realised why I was doing it all wrong, why I was struggling, and what was the best way of avoiding this problem forever.<span class="more"></span> So I implemented all of it in the morning while we were going through migrations. I really shouldn’t do it, but I was quite excited about the prospect of never fighting the thing I’d been fighting for forever. And it worked, and now I think I’m fairly happy with the solution. It’s a small victory, for sure, but it made me quite happy. Two real take aways from&nbsp;this-</p>
<p>“rails g model Order customer:references etc:string” is a great way of linking things that I really should have realised was a thing. I’d thought about it over the weekend, and realised it was a rails only command that we hadn’t done&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Then we did validations, basically using validates: to make sure fields are filled in, and some stuff like object.errors and object.valid? to show what’s going on behind the hood in&nbsp;Rails.</p>
<p>The major part of the day we basically built a rails “Fiver” app, step by step, following a logical&nbsp;sequence.</p>
<p>Then we went drinking to plan our projects. Weird&nbsp;day.</p>
