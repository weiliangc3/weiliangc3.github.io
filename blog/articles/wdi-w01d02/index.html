          <section class="content"><p>Today I learnt that Alex really likes to use analogies. While I personally drift off slightly when the tea and biscuits, ingredients and cooking analogies are employed, it’s probably a good way to normalise otherwise esoteric&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>We went through using git, github, html and css, and now it’s just a matter of getting familiar and using it a lot. One thing’s for sure, I anticipate commitment problems. It seems a little counter intuitive to save and then double save every now and then via committing. Only one thing to do- git&nbsp;gud.</p>
<p>Called my friend to cancel a dinner with his parents at Lurra, which evidently is a meat place because when I got home my significant other had brought me a bone with some meat on it. Good&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Got stuck in with the homework- copying a webpage from a png. Most people stayed back to around 8.30, I left around 9.00 and on the way back realised I wanted to tweak a little bit of the code, so I did. My significant other also pointed out that wayback machine online caches the old webpages that we were assigned to copy. I took a look at the bits I couldn’t figure out after I decided I was done with the homework to confirm some of my suspicions. Maybe I’ll correct it to be more in-line with the original website eventually, but as far as homework goes, I probably should just leave it as I did it, and not ‘cheat’, and just learn about how they actually did it another&nbsp;time.</p>
